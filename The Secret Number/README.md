Vadim has thought of a number x. To ensure that no one can guess it, he appended a positive number of zeros to the right of it, thus obtaining a new number y. However, as a precaution, Vadim decided to spread the number n=x+y. Find all suitable x that Vadim could have thought of for the given n.

INPUT type
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases. In a single line of each test case, there is an integer n — the number spread by Vadim (11≤n≤1018).

OUTPUT type
For each number n, output 0 if there are no suitable x. Otherwise, output the number of suitable x, followed by all suitable x in ascending order.
